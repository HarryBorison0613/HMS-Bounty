This is hospital management system.
Website has three roles - admin, doctor, patient.
I used html, CSS, Bootstrap in frontend and used Node.js, Express.js in backend and used MongoDB as database.
This site implemented such below functions.

1. Set appointment with Date + Time by patient.
2. Appointment list for patient (history)
3. Doctor expertise, Google Map API
4. Sort by doctor expertise / location + Search by doctor name / location / expertise (free search)
5. Twitter connection like the realtor example I sent you, just change it to some medical twitter page instead of real estate.
6. Admin functionality add/remove/update patient/doctors
7. statistics for admin with at least 2 graphs using d3js.org (appointments per month + new patients per day)
8. use of web service - in realtor we used Currency rate of usd and ILS. here maybe get News web service that related to medical.
9. Use of one query which is doing Group By operation in the MongoDB.
10. include the following HTML5 elements:
-video
-canvas
-Aside, footer, header, nav, section
11. include CSS3 elements:
-Text-shadow
-Transition
-Multiple-columns
-Font-face
-Border-radius
